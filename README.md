## About Project ##

I've designed a quiz to test your understanding of popular JavaScript questions for this challenge. The quiz will begin as soon as you click the correct answers on the quiz's introductory screen, at which point a timer will begin counting down as you answer questions. You have sixty seconds to attempt to answer each question.

I still need to add certain acceptance criteria, such as a final score page, but I've opted to leave the quiz as-is for now; it will be modified later.
